    <h1>Chipotle is expensive, this bowl is not!</h1>
    <p>This is pretty much my girlfriend and I's go to meal for those days when we broke af but want something that tastes like we eating out, hope you enjoy</p>
    <li>About a pound of chicken breast or thighs</li>
    <li>1 can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
    <li>2  bell peppers, any color is cool, get creative</li>
    <li>1 can of sweet corn</li>
    <li>1 can of black beans</li>
    <li>About 1 cup of diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>Trader Joes's sweet and spicy Jalapenos (trust me...)</li>
    <li>About a qauter cup of mayo</li>
    <li>Two tablespoons of honey</li>
    <li>One avocado</li>
    <li>Cotija cheese (or any cheese of your choice</li>
    <li>Cilantro</li>
    <li>Salt, pepper, and lemon to taste</li>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Dump the peppers, honey, and lemon into a blender to create a marinade for the chicken, set aside about a half cup of the marinade</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and refrigerate for about 2-3 hours. </li>
        <li>When you're ready to start, get that rice going</li>
        <li>Cut the bell pepper into strips (or diced, nbd) and add them to a saucepan with the corn, under medium heat</li>
        <li>I like my vegetables cooked until brown, but if you're basic and like them soft, go for it</li>
        <li>Heat the beans separtely, or you can cook them with the peppers</li>
        <li>Now for the pollo; personallly, I think air-frying or grill ing is best, but baking has worked out pretty well for me too. Just make sure its nice and crispy when its done</li>
        <li>Take that marinade you set aside, add the mayo an lemon in a blender and poof, you've got a great sauce to add on top!</li>
        <li>Put it all together, and top with the diced tomato, cotija cheese, cilantro, avocado, and chipotle sauce</li>
    </ol>
